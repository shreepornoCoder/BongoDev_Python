Given this list:
numbers = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6, 7, -8, 9, -10]
1. Use map() with a lambda to square all numbers
2. Use filter() with a lambda to keep only positive numbers
3. Use sorted() with a lambda to sort numbers by their absolute value

Hint: Review Python's built-in functions like map(), filter(), and sorted()
